# ML-Coursera (May 2, 2016 - July 24, 2016)
This repositiory contains coding assignmets from Machine Learning course offered by Stanford University. The course is offered on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Prof. Andrew Ng. This is best online course on  Machine Learning I have came across. I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for coming up with such nice and challenging coding assignments which provides insights into various Machine Learning Algorithms in great depth. All assginments are coded in MATLAB.
