# ML-Coursera (May 2, 2016 - July 24, 2016)
This repositiory contains coding assignmets from Machine Learning course offered by Stanford University. The course is offered
on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) by Prof. Andrew Ng. This is best online course on 
Machine Learning I have came across. I would like to thank Prof. Andrew Ng for coming up with such nice and challenging 
coding assignments which provides insights into various Machine Learning Algorithms in great depth.
